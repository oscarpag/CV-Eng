    <p>
        I graduated in Computer Engineering with a specialization in application programming. I also hold a Master's
        Degree in Video Game Design and Programming. I have gained significant professional experience working in multinational companies, 
        where I developed valuable skills in teamwork and application development. I am a fast learner and highly adaptable, which allows me to
        quickly grasp new tools, technologies, and development workflows. Currently, I am focused on video game development and have published 
        two mobile games and one 3D horror game for PC on Steam.
